notesforauthors: "Functions do not include 'weight' because they are sorted by title. Keep the 'title:' value all lowercase for sorting purposes. Always include a 'linktitle' with casing that reflects actual usage of the function. EVERY function needs a description, even if it's only a sentence or two. If possible, include the full URL for the related godoc in `godocref:`."
