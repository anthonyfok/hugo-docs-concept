notesforauthors: "Categories are not required metadata but should mirror the section name (e.g., a file in Functions should contain `categories: [functions]`). If you are adding a document to a specific section of the Hugo docs, be sure to use the appropriate archetype. For more information, visit gohugo.io/contribute-to-hugo/contribute-to-the-hugo-docs/. As always, you can delete `notesforauthors:` before publication or modify accordingly."
