notesforauthors: "1. The publishdate and lastmod are in the context of Hugo and not necessarily the original publication for your website. Tutorials are ordered according to title.
2. TAGS ARE IMPORTANT, but keep the categories at "tutorials." Please try to reuse existing tags whenever possible (see gohugo.io/tags on the docs site).
3. `author:`, `authorurl:`, and `originalurl:` are all optional. If used, please include the *full url*. `originalurl:` is the link to the originally published article, if there is one.
4. As always, feel free to remove 'notesforauthors' before publishing your tutorial."
