In no particular order, here is what is currently being worked on for the Hugo project:

* Intelligently related posts ([#98][])
* Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync. Give the [hosting and deployment][] section a shot.
* Import from other website systems. There are already [existing migration tools][] but they donâ€™t cover all major platforms.
* An interactive web based editor (See the [related Discuss thread][])
* Additional [themes][] (always on-going, contributions welcome!)
* Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes ([#1014][])
* Native support for additional content formats (AsciiDoc [#1435][], reST [#1436][])
* And, last but not least, *your* best ideas!
