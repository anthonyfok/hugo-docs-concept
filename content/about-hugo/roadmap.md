In no particular order, here is what is currently being worked on for the Hugo project:

* Intelligently related posts ({{< issue 98 >}})
* Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync. Give the [hosting and deployment][] section a shot.
* Import from other website systems. There are already [existing migration tools][], but they donâ€™t cover all major platforms.
* An interactive web-based editor (See the [related Discuss thread][])
* Additional [themes][], which are always ongoing and contributions are welcome!
* Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes ({{< issue 1014 >}})
* Native support for additional content formats (AsciiDoc {{< issue 1435>}}, reST {{< issue 1436 >}})
* And, last but not least, [*your* best ideas!][]

## Contributions Welcome

Feel free to [contribute][] or [open a new issue][] if you have an idea for a new feature.
