I wrote Hugo ultimately for a few reasons. First, I was disappointed with
WordPress, my then website solution. With it, I couldn't create
content as efficiently as I wanted to.

WordPress sites rendered slowly and required I be online to write posts. WordPress is known for its constant security updates and horror stories of hacked blogs. I hated writing content in HTML instead of the much simpler Markdown. Overall, I felt like WordPress hindered more than helped. It kept me from writing great content.

I looked at existing static site generators like [Jekyll][], [Middleman][], and [Nanoc][]. All had complicated installation dependencies and an unacceptably long time to render my blog with hundreds of posts. I wanted a framework that would give me rapid feedback while making changes to the templates, and the 5-minute-plus render times were just too slow. In general, the static site generators were very blog-minded and didn't provide for other content types and flexible URLs.

I wanted to develop a fast and full-featured website framework without any
dependencies. The [Go language][] seemed to have all the features I needed
in a language. I began developing Hugo in Go and fell in love with the
language. I hope you will enjoy using Hugo (and [contributing to it][]) as much
as I have writing it.
