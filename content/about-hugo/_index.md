## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a [static site generator][]. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website's end users and an ideal writing experience for authors.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including [Heroku][], [GoDaddy][], [DreamHost][], [GitHub Pages][], [Surge][], [Aerobatic][], [Firebase][], [Google Cloud Storage][], [Amazon S3][], and [CloudFront][] and work well with CDNs. Hugo sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP.

We think of Hugo as the ideal website creation tool. With nearly instant build times and the ability to rebuild whenever a change is made, Hugo provides a very fast feedback, which is essential when you are designing websites and creating content.

## How Fast is Hugo?

## What Does Hugo Do?

In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.

## Who Should Use Hugo?

Hugo is for people that prefer writing in a text editor over a browser.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Hugo is for people building a blog, a company site, a portfolio site, documentation, a single landing page, or a website with thousands of pages.
