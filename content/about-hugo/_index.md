## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is
a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page
with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create
your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are
edited, Hugo is optimized for website viewing for the end users of your site and an ideal writing experience for authors.

Sites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can
be hosted anywhere, including [Heroku][], [GoDaddy][], [DreamHost][],
[GitHub Pages][], [Surge][], [Aerobatic][], [Firebase Hosting][],
[Google Cloud Storage][], [Amazon S3][], and [CloudFront][] and work well
with CDNs. Hugo sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP.

We think of Hugo as the ideal website creation tool. With nearly instant
build times and the ability to rebuild whenever a change is made, Hugo
provides a very fast feedback loop. This is essential when you are
designing websites, but also very useful when creating content.

## How Fast is Hugo?


## What Does Hugo Do?

In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and
templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.

## Who Should Use Hugo?

Hugo is for people that prefer writing in a text editor over
a browser.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without
worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and
databases.

Hugo is for people building a blog, company site, portfolio, tumblog,
documentation, single-page website, or a website with thousands of
pages.
