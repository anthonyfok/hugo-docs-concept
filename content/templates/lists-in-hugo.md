## What is a "List" Template

A list page template is a template used to render multiple pieces of content in a single HTML page (with the exception of the [homepage][] which has a dedicated template). The idea of a list page comes from the [hierarchical mental model of the web][mentalmodel] and is best demonstrated visually:

We are using the term *list* in its truest sense: a sequential arrangement of material, especially in alphabetical or numerical order. Hugo uses list templates to render any place where content is being listed (e.g., taxonomies and sections).
