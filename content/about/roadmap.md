In no particular order, here is what is currently being worked on for the Hugo project:

* Intelligently related posts ({{< gh 98 >}})
* Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync. Give the [hosting and deployment][] section a shot.
* Import from other website systems. There are already [existing migration tools][migrate], but they donâ€™t cover all major platforms.
* An interactive web-based editor (See the [related Discuss thread][])
* Additional [themes][], which are always ongoing and contributions are welcome!
* Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes ({{< gh 1014 >}})
* Native support for additional content formats (AsciiDoc {{< gh 1435>}}, reST {{< gh 1436 >}})
* And, last but not least, [***your*** best ideas!][]

## Contributions Welcome
