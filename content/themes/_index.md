Hugo provides a robust theming system that is easy to implement but capable of producing even the most complicated websites. They are the perfect balance between simplicity and functionality.

The Hugo community has created a large number of diverse themes, all of which are featured in a separate [Hugo themes website][hugothemes].

Hugo themes are powered by the excellent Go template library. If you are new to Go templates, see our [primer on Go templates][goprimer] and are structured in such a way to eliminate code duplication. They are easy to simultaneously customize while retaining upgradability with the upstream theme.
