Hugo is and always will be open source. In addition to contributing to Hugo development and documentation, Hugo also has a Gitter channel ***devoted solely to discussions around development***.

The formal contribution guidelines for Hugo are [detailed in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`][contributionguidelines] in the Hugo source repository on GitHub.
